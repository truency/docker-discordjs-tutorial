## docker-compose


### What is it?!
docker-compose is a tool used to create, define, and "orchastrate" many docker containers at once. That way your bot can have some friends! 
They will not be inside the same container as the bot, but more like neighbors.
We will be using it to give our bot a database using PostgreSQL. You can feel free to use any database you want, just visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) to search for your particular option.


### Installation
You have a few choices here. You can use the one provided by your distributions repos (or Windows), or get the latest source by installing ``python3-pip``.


   > python3-pip: ``pip install docker-compose``

   > Ubuntu/Debian: ``sudo apt install docker-compose``

   > RHEL: ``sudo yum install docker-compose``

   > Pacman: ``sudo pacman -S docker-compose``

   > cURL: ``curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.12.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose``

   > Windows: [docker-compose x86](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.12.0/docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe)

   > Mac: Use cURL.


### Check if it's installed
You can check if docker-compose is installed by running ``docker-compose --version``


### What is docker-compose.yml?
Ah, that will be covered in the next tutorial when I explain it thoroughly, give an example and show you how to orchestrate your own docker-compose file to fit your needs.
