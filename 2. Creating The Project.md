## Creating the project.
Let's get started on creating the bot itself. For this, you will need to create a project folder, install dependencies, etc. 

Let's do that now! (You will need to know how to )

### Creating the project

#### Linux, Mac, WSL (Bash for Windows)
1. ``mkdir my-discord-bot && cd my-discord-bot/`` - This will create the folder for the project and enter in to it.
2. ``touch index.js && npm init --yes`` - This creates a file called ``index.js`` and initializes the project using NPM.
3. ``touch Dockerfile`` - This creates a file for Docker to read from. I will get into this in a later step.
4. ``npm install discordjs/discord.js --save`` - This installs the later master branch of discord.js which is recommended.
5. ``touch settings.json`` - This creates a configuration file that stores our bot's token.

#### Windows
1. ``mkdir my-discord-bot && cd my-discord-bot/`` - This will create the folder for the project and enter in to it.
2. ``type nul > index.js && npm init --yes`` - This creates a file called ``index.js`` and initializes the project using NPM.
3. ``type nul > Dockerfile`` - This creates a file for Docker to read from. I will get into this in a later step.
4. ``npm install discordjs/discord.js --save`` - This installs the later master branch of discord.js which is recommended.
5. ``type nul > settings.json`` - This creates a configuration file that stores our bot's token.

### Opening the project
You will now open our new project in your favorite IDE/editor. I personally use Visual Studio Code, but use whatever you want to make yourself more comfortable.


Now open your new settings.json. This is the format we will be using:
```json
{
    "token": "--your bots token--"
}
```
and save that. This will store our bot's information to be used on startup.


### Creating the bot itself!

Inside of ``index.js``, we will create the bot. Here is an example I will be using:

```js
const { Client } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./settings');
const client = new Client();

client.on('ready', () => console.log('Ready!'));

client.on('message', (msg) => {
    if (msg.author.bot) return;

    if (msg.content.startsWith('!ping')) {
        msg.channel.send('!gnip');
    }
});

client.login(token);
```

Now running the bot with ``node index.js`` inside our console, the bot should now respond with ``!gnip`` when presented with ``!ping``!

Great! Now everything is up and running, let's put this inside a container.
